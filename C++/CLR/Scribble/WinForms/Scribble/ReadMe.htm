The sample files include two solutions, one with an MFC implementation of the Scribble sample and the other with a Window Forms implementation of the Scribble sample. Each of the feature areas that are demonstrated in the sample solutions are described in the following sample descriptions:</p><dl><dt>Walkthrough: Exposing a .NET Plug-in Model</dt><dd><p>The MFC Scribble solution is extended to expose a .NET object model. Furthermore, the sample also exposes a plug-in architecture that enables .NET plug-ins to interact seamlessly with the MFC Scribble solution.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt>Walkthrough: Using /clr:pure Features</dt><dd><p>Windows Forms Scribble solution is extended to include some native classes that contain static data. The Windows Forms Scribble solution also exposes Windows Forms controls that must be usable from the Windows Forms designer. Building the sample with the /clr:pure option addresses potential issues with those scenarios.</p></dd></dl><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Security Note </th></tr><tr><td><p>This sample code is provided to illustrate a concept and should not be used in applications or Web sites, as it may not illustrate the safest coding practices.</p></td></tr></table></div><h1 class="heading">To build this sample</h1><div id="procedureSection0" class="section"><ul><li><p>See the above walkthroughs for the correct procedure to build the application.</p></li></ul></div><h1 class="heading">To run this sample</h1><div id="procedureSection1" class="section"><ul><li><p>See the above walkthroughs for the correct procedure to run the application.</p></li></ul></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footerLine"></div>
